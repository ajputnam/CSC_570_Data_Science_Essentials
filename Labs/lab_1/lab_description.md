# Lab 1 iPython Notebook and the Titanic Dataset.
This lab is primarily housekeeping for future labs.   We're going to be setting up python and getting the kaggle titanic dataset on our machines.

In this class, I'll accept code created in either R or python.   Both are excellent data science toolkits.   I will be working in, and using, python examples and the very powerful iPython notebook.   


Python

If you'd like to use python as well, please install Anaconda (link).  

If you're new to python, you may want to work through a few examples.  There are many different introductions to python out there on the web.   You're welcome to use any of them.  Some of my favorites are:

* Google's python class:  https://developers.google.com/edu/python/
* Code Academy:  http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python
* Python Guide:  http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/
I'll be covering more python as we go on, but you'll need to learn the basics (variables, data structures, looping, control) on your own.


Titanic Dataset

This will be our first dataset.  You can download it from here:

http://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted/data

You may need to create an account on kaggle.com to download it.  You'll need train.csv and test.csv.
