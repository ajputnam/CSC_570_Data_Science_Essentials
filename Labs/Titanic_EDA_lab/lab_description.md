# Titanic EDA Lab
For this lab you'll be using the titanic dataset (train.csv).   Your assignment is to create an Exploratory Data Analysis of the Titanic Data.   You may use R or Python to turn in your EDA.

For each variable (except name), you'll need to know at least the following information:   
1.  Is the variable categorical or continuous
2.  Are there missing values?
3. Min, Max, Mean, and Standard Deviation of the continuous variables.
4. Histograms describing the distribution of the variable.
5.  EDA should be completed for these fields:  'PassengerId', 'Survived', 'Pclass', 'Sex', 'Age', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Ticket', 'Fare', 'Cabin', and 'Embarked'
If there are other explorations you'd like to include in your EDA, please feel free to do so.  Go where your imagination takes you.
