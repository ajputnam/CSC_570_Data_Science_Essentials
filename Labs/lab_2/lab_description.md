We're going to be using GitHub to turn in your code. Github is a common Version Control System that's often used by the open source community.   Working with Git will help you build a portfolio of code to show off.

You'll need to create a GitHub account and learn how to use GitHub here:

After that, you should create a python program that prints 'hello world' and exits. Check this into your git repo and submit a link to it.
