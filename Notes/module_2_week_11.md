## Unsupervised learning clustering
unlabed data set

clustering algorithm finds groups of simular data sometime
market segmentation, social netowrk analysis
organize computing clustering
astronomical data analysis

kmeans Algorithm steps
finds what examples are closer to the cluster point.
move cluster point to the average point
find what examples are closer to the cluster point.
repeat until converges


kmeans Algorithm steps
input - k (number of clusters)
training set
